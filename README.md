Firebase Assignment - Train Scheduler (Basic - Recommended)



Overview

In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.




Setup


We'll leave that up to you -- however you like. Just make sure you're using Firebase to store data, GitHub to backup your project, and GitHub Pages to host your finished site.



Commits

Having an active and healthy commit history on GitHub is important for your future job search. It is also extremely important for making sure your work is saved in your repository. If something breaks, committing often ensures you are able to go back to a working version of your code.



Committing often is a signal to employers that you are actively working on your code and learning.


We use the mantra “commit early and often.”  This means that when you write code that works, add it and commit it!
Numerous commits allow you to see how your app is progressing and give you a point to revert to if anything goes wrong.



Be clear and descriptive in your commit messaging.


When writing a commit message, avoid vague messages like "fixed." Be descriptive so that you and anyone else looking at your repository knows what happened with each commit.


We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!



Submission on BCS


Please submit both the deployed Github.io link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!



Instructions



Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:


When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
Train Name
Destination 
First Train Time -- in military time
Frequency -- in minutes
Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!
